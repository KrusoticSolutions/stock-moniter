# Stock Market API

This is a demo stock market application.

i've used https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/ (Aplha vantage api) for intraday time frame but it's not providing real-time data. it's providing yesterday data.
but as demo project it should be fine.

for fetching all the tickers and symbols i'm using [Wallstreet Odds](https://www.wallstreetodds.com/api-overview/).
